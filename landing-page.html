				<p>
					Every day is taco ipsum tuesday. Shrimp tacos are tasty tacos! Let’s do a beef and a chicken, and one with both. Make it a double there pal. Give me all your tacos. It’s a wonderful morning for breakfast tacos. I’ve been following that taco truck around all day. It’s long been rumored that the chupacabra is really just a crazed man who’s local taco shop went out of business. Tacos Al pastor/De Adobada are made of thin pork steaks seasoned with adobo seasoning, then skewered and overlapped on one another on a vertical rotisserie cooked and flame-broiled as it spins.
