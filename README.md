DDC Assignment: Code the provided wireframe from scratch using the Bootstrap4 framework

Rules
1. Create a new project that contains ONE PAGE that successfully implements the layout shown in the wireframes below. This layout should be fully responsive, and conform to the mobile layout on small devices.
2. Use Bootstrap's built-in classes to the greatest extent possible for style. Add custom styling of your own only after all Bootstrap possibilities have been exhausted.
3. Use whatever content, placeholder images and text you want.
4. You can copy snippets from the Bootstrap Official Documentation where you need to, BUT no copy/pasting from pre-built templates, other websites, or existing projects! The challenge here is to create this layout from scratch.
5. Load ALL dependencies in the HTML <head> tag. Why? Because your technical lead said so. :P
